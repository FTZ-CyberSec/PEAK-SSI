# PEAK-SSI

### This is a collection of scripts for the SSI authorization function in the PEAK project.
Eventually they are all supposed to be connected into a cohesive program.

### List of Scripts:

1. Connect.py -> connects two agents with each other
2. IssueCredential.py -> Creates DIDs for Agent A and B and Issues a non-Blockchain credential from Agent A to Agent B

### To-Do / Next Steps

1. Blockchain Credential Issueing
2. Presentation of Credential
3. Revocation of Credential
4. Creating Agents and Logic Specific to PEAK
5. Combining Scripts and exchanging hard coded stuff to inputs
6. UI?
